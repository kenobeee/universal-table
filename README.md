# Starter Client-Side Web Application Development Pattern

This starter pattern provides a foundation for developing client-side web applications using React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Styled Components. It includes a basic setup with Webpack.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A library for managing application state in React applications.
- **Styled Components**: A library for styling React components using tagged template literals.

## Scripts

- **start**: Runs the webpack dev server in development mode.
- **build**: Builds the application for production using webpack.
- **eslint**: Runs ESLint to lint TypeScript files in the `src` directory and fix issues automatically.

## Development Dependencies

- **Webpack**: A module bundler for JavaScript applications.
- **Webpack CLI**: Command-line interface for webpack.
- **Webpack Dev Server**: Development server for webpack.
- **HTML Webpack Plugin**: Simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles.
- **Clean Webpack Plugin**: Cleans your build directory before each build.
- **Copy Webpack Plugin**: Copies individual files or entire directories to the build directory.
- **File Loader**: Loads files as assets in webpack.
- **ESLint**: A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX.
- **ESLint Plugins**: Plugins for ESLint to support React and React Hooks linting.
- **TypeScript Loader**: Allows webpack to load TypeScript files.
- **tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin**: Resolves TypeScript module paths using tsconfig.json.

## Production Dependencies

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React DOM**: Provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app.
- **React Redux**: Official React bindings for Redux.
- **Styled Components**: Library for styling React components with tagged template literals.

## Browserslist Configuration

Specifies the list of browsers supported by the application.

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Node.js is installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository to your computer.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Advantages of Using This Stack

- **Productivity**: The combination of React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Styled Components offers a productive environment for building modern web applications.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides static typing, which helps catch errors during development and improves code quality.
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit simplifies state management in React applications, making it easier to manage and share application state.
- **Component Styling**: Styled Components allows for easy and intuitive styling of React components, enhancing code organization and reusability.
